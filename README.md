Tylix rejects **traditional payment methods** in games and aims to be a new generation payment method. Players will be able to buy the game units they want immediately after registering their wallets, at any time they want, easily, quickly and securely by approving all their future purchases from their own wallet with a simple approval system without wasting time. Tylix will serve every segment with a wallet, so instead of using credit cards obtained through banks and going through a laborious approval process before buying any units in games, you will be able to have the content you want quickly with your wallet without dealing with banks. <br/>

It also means that you can make purchases without integrating your credit and debit cards into any gaming world, so you won't have to spread your card details, and you'll be able to store your information safely.
